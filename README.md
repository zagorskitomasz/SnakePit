# How is it done?

Build in libGDX. Snakes use some AI methods. They look for food (yellow dots) and choose target considering distance and overload â€“ if one food object is targeted by more snakes itâ€™s less attractive for others. If snake canâ€™t go to target due to barriers (other snakes) it choose other target or just move. If no food object is targeted, snakes decide if more free space they have on front, left or right side and move in choosen direction. Snakes avoid collisions, but sometimes (especially if they are long) they stuck in dead ends.

Of course you can control one snake in the pit. ðŸ˜‰

# How can it be improved?

There could be added some metagame (points, levels etc.) to improve playability. Now itâ€™s just demo of snake control methods.
